# Izhikevich Live Script

This Live Script simulates the Izhikevich model for spiking neurons using MATLAB code in the form of a Live Script. Links to the original paper and the book Dynamical Systems in Neuroscience are provided in the Live Script. 

The Live Script demonstrates the spiking response of a neuron having certain membrane properties in response to the injection of an external current pulse. 

The user can modify the parameters. The first group of parameters change the amplitude and width of the current pulse whereas the second group deals with membrane parameters.

A live task then automatically detects peaks in the simulated spiking neuron.
